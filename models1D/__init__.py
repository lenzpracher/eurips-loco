1D Neural Operator Models Package

This package contains 1D implementations of neural operator models
for use with 1D PDE experiments (Burgers, KdV).

Models:
- fno: 1D Fourier Neural Operator
- loco: 1D LOCO (previously SNO) - Spectral Neural Operator
- hybrid: 1D Hybrid (previously FSNO) - Fourier-Spectral Neural Operator
